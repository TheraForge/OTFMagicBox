###################################################################################################################################
# The AppSysParameters.yml file provides the structure to design your health application.
# The structure contains the keys for which you can assign the value according to your application requirements.
# Some of the keys are used for the design of the application, such as Fonts and Colors.
# And some other keys are related to the application features, such as Onboarding, Consent etc.


##############################################################################
#                   IMPORTANT RULES TO USE THIS FILE                         #
##############################################################################
# 1. Kindly do not change the indentation of this file. Suppose if you change the indentation then this particular yaml file key - value will not be read.
# 2. Do not delete any of the keys and lines from this file.
# 3. Do not edit the Objects and keys names.
# 4. Only the values of the keys within the quotes have to be edited.
# 5. All the values should be mentioned within the quotes(""), otherwise that particular key's value will not be read and the default value will be displayed.


# Key and Value:
# Text written on left side of the punctuation (:) is called as Key and text written on right side is called as Value.
# Example: teamEmail: "info@hippocratestech.com", here "teamEmail" is the Key and whatever is displayed after punctuation (:) within the colon "info@hippocratestech.com" is the value assigned for that Key.


# Default Values:-
# Default values will be displayed in your application in the format "Default: "
# Example: Key teamName default value will be displayed like "Default: team name", you can see this on the screen where this key value will be displayed.


# Edit Values:-
# If you want to edit the basic details like title of the study, then go to key studyTitle and edit the value part which is under quotes("")
# Example: studyTitle: "TheraForge" ---> studyTitle: "NewValue"


# Edit List:-
# If you have list of things, you can denote that sequence using hyphen ("-")
# Object which has list of values, you can add and delete any number of key-values. While adding a new value to the list, all the keys within that list value should be declared.
# Example: Consent which has a set of values like title, summary and content. So, while adding new value for that list all the three properties(title, summary and content) should be declared.
# Example: currently Consent contains 4 values.

# Edit Boolean Object:-
# Some of the objects will have a Boolean value("true" or "false").
# Example: "useCareKit", for this key if you assign a value "true" then Schedule and Contacts views will be displayed. Otherwise Schedule and Contacts views will not be displayed.

 # Onboarding
 # Onboarding contains number of pages of image and description values. You can add any number of values.
 # Image can be any SF Symbols(version 1.1), Emoji Symbols or any other images from Assets.
 # It is mandatory to write the exact spelling for the image value, if the image is not found then the default string will be displayed.
 # If you are new to SF Symbols then read this apple document: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/
 # You can install SF Symbol 1.1 from https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/ and choose any symbol as per your requirement and write the exact spelling of that particular symbol in the value field of image.
 # Example: If the application requires a message symbol then, I look for a message symbol from the sf-symbols and check the exact name of that symbol and write the same value for the image property (image: "message").
 # If you would like to input your own image then save that image in the Assets folder of the project with a descriptive name and write the same name for the image property value field.
