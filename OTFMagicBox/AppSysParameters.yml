#                                           Digital Health Application Customization Guide                                        #
###################################################################################################################################
# The AppSysParameters.yml file provides the structure to design your health application.
# The structure contains the keys for which you can assign the value according to your application requirements.
# Some of the keys are used for the design of the application, such as Fonts and Colors.
# And some other keys are related to the application features, such as Onboarding, Consent etc.


##############################################################################
#                   IMPORTANT RULES TO USE THIS FILE                         #
##############################################################################
# 1. Kindly do not change the indentation of this file. Suppose if you change the indentation then this particular yaml file key - value will not be read.
# 2. Do not delete any of the keys and lines from this file.
# 3. Do not edit the Objects and keys names.
# 4. Only the values of the keys within the quotes have to be edited.
# 5. All the values should be mentioned within the quotes(''), otherwise that particular key's value will not be read and the default value will be displayed.


# Key and Value:
# Text written on left side of the punctuation (:) is called as Key and text written on right side is called as Value.
# Example: teamEmail: 'contact@TheraForge.com', here "teamEmail" is the Key and whatever is displayed after punctuation (:) within the colon 'contact@TheraForge.com' is the value assigned for that Key.


# Default Values:-
# Default values will be displayed in your application in the format 'Default: '
# Example: Key teamName default value will be displayed like 'Default: team name', you can see this on the screen where this key value will be displayed.


# Edit Values:-
# If you want to edit the basic details like title of the study, then go to key studyTitle and edit the value part which is under quotes('')
# Example: studyTitle: 'TheraForge' ---> studyTitle: 'NewValue'


# Edit List:-
# If you have list of things, you can denote that sequence using hyphen ('-')
# Object which has list of values, you can add and delete any number of key-values. While adding a new value to the list, all the keys within that list value should be declared.
# Example: Consent which has a set of values like title, summary and content. So, while adding new value for that list all the three properties(title, summary and content) should be declared.
# Example: currently Consent contains 4 values.
# consent:
#   - title: "Overview"
#     summary: "Hi there"
#     content: "Hi there"
#
#   - title: "Privacy"
#     summary: "Patient data provides an invaluable resource for improving operational and clinical efficiencies."
#     content: "Patient data provides an invaluable resource for improving operational and clinical efficiencies."
#
#   - title: "DataUse"
#     summary: "Healthcare data collection is used to make digital analysis faster and more accurate."
#     content: "Healthcare data allows to prescribe treatments and make clinical decisions with greater accuracy, eliminating the guesswork often involved in treatment,# resulting in lower costs and enhanced patient care."
#
#   - title: "StudyTasks"
#     summary: "Study tasks involve many aspects of daily functionalities."
#     content: "Health-related tasks involve many aspects of daily function, including personal hygiene and nutrition, safety and comfort, physical fitness, sleep quality, stress management, as well as the planning and coordination to accomplish these personal tasks."
     
# Now you can add a new Consent value at any position in the list according to your requirements.
# Most importantly new Consent value should maintain the correct indentation and must include all the three keys, as shown below:
#
#   - title: "New title"
#     summary: "New summary."
#     content: "New Content."


# Edit Boolean Object:-
# Some of the objects will have a Boolean value('true' or 'false').
# Example: 'useCareKit', for this key if you assign a value 'true' then Schedule and Contacts views will be displayed. Otherwise Schedule and Contacts views will not be displayed.

 # Onboarding
 # Onboarding contains an array of image and description values. You can add any number of values.
 # Image can be any SF Symbols(version 1.1), Emoji Symbols or any other images from Assets.
 # It is mandatory to write the exact spelling for the image value, if the image is not found then the default string will be displayed.
 # If you are new to SF Symbols then read this apple document: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/
 # You can install SF Symbol 1.1 from https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/ and choose any symbol as per your requirement and write the exact spelling of that particular symbol in the value field of image.
 # Example: If the application requires a message symbol then, I look for a message symbol from the sf-symbols and check the exact name of that symbol and write the same value for the image property (image: 'message').
 # If you would like to input your own image then save that image in the Assets folder of the project with a descriptive name and write the same name for the image property value field.
