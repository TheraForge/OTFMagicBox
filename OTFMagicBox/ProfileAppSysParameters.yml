# The AppSysParameters.yml file provides the structure to design your health application.
# The structure contains the keys for which you can assign the value according to your application requirements.
# Some of the keys are used for the design of the application, such as Fonts and Colors.
# And some other keys are related to the application features, such as Onboarding, Consent etc.

#                   IMPORTANT RULES TO USE THIS FILE                         #
##############################################################################
# 1. Kindly do not change the indentation of this file. Suppose if you change the indentation then this particular yaml file key - value will not be read.
# 2. Do not delete any of the keys and lines from this file.
# 3. Do not edit the Objects and keys names.
# 4. Only the values of the keys within the quotes have to be edited.
# 5. All the values should be mentioned within the quotes(""), otherwise that particular key's value will not be read and the default value will be displayed.


# Key and Value:
# Text written on left side of the punctuation (:) is called as Key and text written on right side is called as Value.
# Example: teamEmail: "info@hippocratestech.com", here "teamEmail" is the Key and whatever is displayed after punctuation (:) within the colon "info@hippocratestech.com" is the value assigned for that Key.


# Default Values:-
# Default values will be displayed in your application in the format "Default: "

# Edit Values:-
# If you want to edit the basic details like title of the study, then go to key studyTitle and edit the value part which is under quotes("")
# Example: studyTitle: "TheraForge" ---> studyTitle: "NewValue"

# Some of the objects will have a Boolean value("true" or "false").
# Example: "useCareKit", for this key if you assign a value "true" then Schedule and Contacts views will be displayed. Otherwise Schedule and Contacts views will not be displayed.
